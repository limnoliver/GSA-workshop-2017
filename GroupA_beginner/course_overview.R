# navigating around R Studio

# "Projects"

# use R as a calculator
  # adding
  # multiplication
  # power

# saving objects
 # x <- 4+5
 # y <- 8 + x

# data types - numeric, characters, NAs
  # name = "Bob"
  # str(name)

# use functions

# packages and functions within packages
  # mean, sd, max, min, etc

# installing packages

# getting help from the console - help for functions, vignettes, but google!
  # example - mean(5,6,7) doesnt work, need a vector
  # ?ggplot, ?plot, ?boxplot

# data structures - vectors and data frames
  # have to combine numbers for mean to work, so how to create a vector?
  # X <- C(1,5,7,10)

# getting data - read.csv - other read functions
